# ðŸ”¢ Week02 Alumni Project: PostgreSQL Query

### Goal: Build a Simple DB and submit a photo of the results of a complicated query

### What it should look like:

At least 20 students in your database. The query should return all students who graduated, live in Boston, and are under 30 in ascending order based on id.

| id    | first_name     | last_name   | cohort | grad status | age | city | state | neighborhood |
| ---------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:| ------:|
|   05  | Sarah | Sanders | 2017a | graduated | 22 | Boston | MA | JP |
